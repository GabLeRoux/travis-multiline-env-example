# Travis-CI multiline env variables example

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/GabLeRoux/travis-multiline-env-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/GabLeRoux/travis-multiline-env-example)

I'm trying to generate a file based on an environment variable which contains a few lines. 
Note: `gitlab-ci` does support this out of the boxs. Just trying to do the same with Travis.
